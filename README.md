This project utilizes both HTML and CSS to create a simple webpage that details the timeline of Roman Emperor Julius Caesar. Being my first project, I was able to learn/practice basic HTML structure, adding hyperlinks through the <a> element, and including images through the <img> element. Furthermore, I gained more experience using CSS to adjust the positions of elements by modifying the margin values, set images to responsively resize depending on the width, and utilize basic background colors. Finishing this project definitely required a few hours due to inexperience, but I had an enjoyable experience and discovered that learning through projects is very effective.
